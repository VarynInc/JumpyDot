    <h1>JumpyDot WordPress Notes</h1>
    <p>We made several changes to the WordPress template, this document will attempt to indicate the changes that were made. Next time we upgrade hopefully we will not lose anything</p>
    <h2>Changes Made to WordPress</h2>
    <p>Before you upgrade you should do three things:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a backup of the entire /blog folder in case you need to reference something overwritten in an upgrade.</li>
        <li>Make a backup of the entire database.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>wp-config.php</h3>
    <p>Note the reference to /procs/common.php this gets the database connection info.</p>
    <p>Setup the database connection info and the WP authentication keys</p>
    <h3>wp-content/themes</h3>
    <p>Added the ViewPoint theme from Theme Forest</p>
    <p>Edited the following theme files. Do a diff on these files if you update so you can reapply the changes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>header.php</li>
        <li>css/base.css</li>
        <li>css/layout.css</li>
        <li>images/* (updated to JumpyDot images)</li>
    </ul>
